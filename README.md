"DigiXam" is a web-based online e axmination platform. I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap for designing the frontend, and the backend is designed by using Java & MySQL (Database). This Online Examination System is a software solution, which allows any institute or organizations to arrange, conduct and manage examinations via an online environment. The main goal of this online examination system is to effectively evaluate the student through a totally automated system that reduces a lot of time for the users. It gives a single platform environment to evaluate all the things together.
